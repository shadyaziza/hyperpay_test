### Hyperpay Test

This is a fork from [here](https://github.com/nyartech/hyperpay/tree/main/example).

According to [docs](https://wordpresshyperpay.docs.oppwa.com/tutorials/mobile-sdk/integration/server), two endpoints must be provided

- Checkout endpoint
- Status endpoint

In addition, in order to successfully call the checkout endpoint, client side needs to have the `entityId` that corresponds to a payment method (e.g: Mada , credit card or apple pay).
